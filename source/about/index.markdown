What I'm currently interested in:

Continuous integration using TravisCI, Jenkins, BrowserStack, SauceLabs. <br />
Frameworks and tools: Protractor, Cucumber, RSpec, Capybara, JMeter, Selenium <br />
Methodologies: e2e, Agile QA, Automation, Functional Black-box testing. <br />
Manual testing is a great opportunity to be creative. I do this. <br />
Writing highly technical test results are the ones geeks value more. <br />

### Open Source
Have been more active in the open source community trying to give back as much as I can. <br />
Some contributions in Protractor, Jasmine, Thor, Kramdown, J50Npi, SauceLabs, Rails docs, RSpec docs, Rake docs. <br />

### Web & Apps Development / Design

Frameworks and tools: NodeJS, Rails, Git, REST, JSON, BDD, jQuery. <br />
Areas of expertise: Back-end, Front-end, Web Apps, Desktop Apps, Wireframing. <br />
Refactoring fun. <br />

### SysAdmin, DevOps and Configuration Management
Virtualization technologies like VMWare and VirtualBox are of my favorites. <br />
Cloud Infrastructure: AWS, Docker.io. <br />
Operating systems polyglot: *nix(Ubuntu Linux), Mac OSX, Microsoft Windows. <br />

### Values
Self managed. Ownership: I've got it, you don't need to think about it. <br />
Initiative: Getting things done. Problem solving: Nothing can't be solved. <br />
Honesty, humility, thoughtfulness, kindness, appreciation, happiness. <br />
Team work: We before I. <br />
