An experienced computer science professional in love with computers since the early age of 13.  <br />
Having worked in lean startups and multi-national companies i try to take the best of both worlds. <br />
My desire is to use my capacities in a web product that provides positive impact on people's lives.<br />
Also enjoy working in more that 1 area of expertise not necessarily at the same time:

### QA with Automation
Continuous integration using ```TravisCI, Jenkins, SauceLabs``` <br />
Frameworks and tools: ```Cucumber, RSpec, Capybara, JMeter, ApacheBench, Selenium``` <br />
Methodologies: ```Agile QA, Automation, Unit testing, Performance, Black-box, White-box``` <br />
Manual testing is a great opportunity to be creative. I do this. <br />
Writing highly technical test results are the ones geeks value more.

### Web & Apps Development / Design
Programming languages: ```Ruby, JavaScript, SQL, HTML5, CSS, SASS, Coffeescript``` <br />
Frameworks and tools: ```Rails, Git, REST, JSON, Services, BDD, jQuery, AJAX, CMS, ERP, UX``` <br />
Areas of expertise: ```Back-end, Front-end, Web Apps, Desktop Apps, Wireframing/Sketching``` <br />
I love refactoring, like OOP, enjoy Design Patterns and try to avoid heavy-weight legacy tools.

### SysAdmin, DevOps and Configuration Management
Virtualization technologies like VMWare and VirtualBox are of my favorites. <br />
Admin automation tools like ```veewee, vagrant, chef, knife, berkshelf``` <br />
Cloud Infrastructure: ```AWS, Heroku, Dreamhost or any VPS/hosting service``` <br />
Operating systems polyglot: ```*nix(Ubuntu Linux), Max OS X, Microsoft Windows(all flavors)```

### Open Source
Have been more active in the open source community trying to give back as much as i can: <br />
Some contribituions:
[Thor](http://goo.gl/T0MnVZ) | [Kramdown](http://goo.gl/alYJty) | [J50Npi](http://goo.gl/E8nGnq) | [SauceLabs](http://goo.gl/1PmC2R) <br />
I also update documentation errors when i find them:
[Rails](http://goo.gl/qL32aY) | [RSpec](http://goo.gl/1Gu0Gj) | [Rake](http://goo.gl/bZz4PP) | [Tilt](http://goo.gl/Rmg1w8)

### Values
Self managed. Ownership: I've got it, you don't need to think about it. <br />
Initiative: Getting things done. Problem solving: Nothing can't be solved. <br />
Honesty, humility, thoughtfulness, kindness, appreciation, happiness. <br />
Team work: We before I.

### Legacy Technologies
Some of my background is on other technologies that i'm not so exited about now: <br />
```PHP, SQL Server 2000, Java, C# .NET, Visual Basic, MS D.O.S. scripting```

### Fun
I blog, tweet and publicly bookmark about the things i'm working on or interested in:  <br />
